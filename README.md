I made this becasue I was tired of using extensions or skeezy 3rd party sites to download YT videos/audio for one-off projects.

[Live site on fly.io](https://go-youtube-dl.fly.dev/)

I could absolutely have done a better job with the frontend but I cannot be bothered to build and scaffold an entire react app when I'm only using the site for 90 seconds.
